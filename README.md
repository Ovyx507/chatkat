# chatkat
Chatting Application using Java Sockets - TCP


Instructions :

Start run.bat. Three clients will be opened for you and you can test the chat between the three consoles.
If there's a problem with connecting from client to server you'll have to change the Gazda variable from ChatClient.java with the IP that you have on your own LAN. You can put ChatClient on another computer from your LAN and use it from there to communicate on the local network. Have fun !
